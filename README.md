This is my first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course!

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only **HTML**. It will have a homepage and a few links to individual recipe pages.

## What I Will Learn

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated:

- Structuring content with proper HTML tags
- Using anchor tags (`<a>`) to link between pages
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages
- Organizing files and folders
- Practicing version control with Git and GitHub

This project will give me hands-on experience with creating a static multi-page website from scratch.
